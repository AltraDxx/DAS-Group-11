Welcome to our coffee quality analysis project repository! In this project, we aim to investigate the influence of various features of coffee on the classification of a batch of coffee as either good or poor. This analysis will be conducted using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), followed by a presentation summarizing our findings.

Objective
Our main objective is to understand how different features of coffee, such as aroma, flavor, acidity, and others, contribute to the overall quality classification of a batch of coffee.

Data
We will be working with a dataset, which includes information on various features of coffee batches along with their quality classification (good or poor).

Analysis Steps
Data Preprocessing: We will clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure its suitability for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We will perform EDA to gain insights into the distribution and relationships among the variables.
Modeling: Utilizing Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), we will build predictive models to understand the influence of different coffee features on quality classification.
Model Evaluation: We will evaluate the performance of our models and interpret the results to draw meaningful conclusions.
Presentation: Finally, we will summarize our findings and insights in a presentation format.
