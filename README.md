Welcome to our coffee quality analysis project repository! In this project, we aim to investigate the influence of various features of coffee on the classification of a batch of coffee as either good or poor. This analysis will be conducted using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), followed by a presentation summarizing our findings.

Our main objective is to understand how different features of coffee, such as aroma, flavor, acidity, and others, contribute to the overall quality classification of a batch of coffee.
We will be working with a dataset, which includes information on various features of coffee batches along with their quality classification (good or poor).

We will clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure its suitability for analysis. Then, We will perform EDA to gain insights into the distribution and relationships among the variables. After that, we will build predictive models to understand the influence of different coffee features on quality classification and evaluate the performance of our models and interpret the results to draw meaningful conclusions. Finally, we will summarize our findings and insights in a presentation format.

Here are the contributors(in no particular order): Fangyi Zhou, Manni Wang, Xinyi Wang, Zhixin LI and Xingyu DU

In conclusion, our analysis aims to provide valuable insights for the local coffee farmer to understand the factors influencing coffee quality classification, thereby aiding in informed decision-making and quality improvement efforts.
